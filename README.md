## 💡 Design Decisions

**Color Scheme**: Purple-blue gradient represents AI/technology, while green accents connect to WhatsApp branding.

**Typography**: Large, bold headings for impact; readable body text for accessibility.

**Animations**: Subtle motion to guide user attention without overwhelming; stagger effects for content reveals.
